# liri-node-app



Create and use a standard GitHub repository. As this is a CLI App, it cannot be deployed to GitHub pages or Heroku. This time you'll need to include screenshots, a GIF, and/or a video showing us that you have the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots/GIFs or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.

In order to meet the Employer Competitive standards and be ready to show your application to employers, the `README.md` file should meet the following criteria:

Putting through commands for movies, songs, band concerts to find information based on what you're searching

If you search for a movie you will get information on 
if you don't type in a certain move under movie-this you will get information on the film 'mr. nobody'

If you search for a song you will get information on 

If you search for an artist you will get information on 

1. Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)
2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
5. Contain a link to a deployed version of the app
6. Clearly list the technologies used in the app
7. State your role in the app development

Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading in this assignment.
